Pepper

@ Anand Gupta, 2012

A Google Talk Robot attached to posterous   

Install 
-------

Pepper uses bundler to get her deps. 
Use 'bundle install' to set things up.

You'll need to provide Gtalk credentials for Pepper:

Fill in: 
botUsername = ''
botPassword = ''

in bot/mcore.rb

You can customise Pepper's behavior in pepper.rb

Run
---

Just execute run.sh

If you peek inside run.sh, you'll see that all it does is bundle exec, making
Pepper something perfectly suitable for use on Heroku.
